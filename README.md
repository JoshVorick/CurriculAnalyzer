# Welcome to onTrack

onTrack is made of several parts inculding webscraper, a database, a web server, and a web page. The webscraper creates a JSON object of courses. 

Currently our database is hosted locally. We will soon move it over to AWS.

In order to view our website navigate to CurriculAnalyzer/tree/master/back_end/templates and click on index.html. This is our main tree visualization.
